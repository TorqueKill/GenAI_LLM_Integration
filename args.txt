Edge Intelligence has the potential to provide artificial intelligence for every person and every organization at any place.\\nWhat is Edge Computing\\nEdge Computing is the concept of capturing, storing, processing, and analyzing data closer to the location where it is needed to improve response times and save bandwidth. Hence, edge computing is a distributed computing framework that brings applications closer to data sources such as IoT devices, local end devices, or edge servers.\\nThe rationale of edge computing is that computing should happen in the proximity of data sources. Therefore, we envision that edge computing could have as big an impact on our society as we have witnessed with cloud computing.\\nWhy We Need Edge Intelligence\\nData Is Generated At the Network Edge\\n\\nSource: https://viso.ai/edge-ai/edge-intelligence-deep-learning-with-edge-computing/\\nTitle: \\nContent: One of the most popular AI techniques, deep learning, brings the ability to identify patterns and detect anomalies in the data sensed by the edge device, for example, population distribution, traffic flow, humidity, temperature, pressure, and air quality.\\nThe insights extracted from the sensed data are then fed to the real-time predictive decision-making applications (e.g., safety and security, automation, traffic control, inspection) in response to the fast-changing environments, increasing operational efficiency.\\nWhat is Edge Intelligence and Edge ML\\n\\nSource: https://viso.ai/edge-ai/edge-intelligence-deep-learning-with-edge-computing/\\nTitle: \\nContent: To address those challenges, deep learning services tend to resort to edge computing. Therefore, deep learning models have to be customized to fit the resource-constrained edge. Meanwhile, deep learning applications need to be carefully optimized to balance the trade-off between inference accuracy and execution latency.\\nWhat’s Next for Edge Intelligence and Edge Computing?\\nWith the emergence of both AI and IoT comes the need to push the AI frontier from the cloud to the edge device. Edge computing has been a widely recognized solution to support computation-intensive AI and computer vision applications in resource-constrained environments.\\nIntelligent Edge, also called Edge AI, is a novel paradigm of bringing edge computing and AI together with the goal of powering ubiquitous AI applications for organizations across industries.

ML@Edge is about controlling the lifecycle of one or more ML models deployed to a fleet of edge devices. The ML model lifecycle can start on the cloud side (on Amazon SageMaker, for instance) but normally ends on a standalone deployment of the model on the edge device. Each scenario demands different ML model lifecycles that can be composed by many stages, such as data collection; data preparation; model building, compilation, and deployment to the edge device; model loading and running; and repeating the lifecycle.\\n\\nSource: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/demystifying-machine-learning-at-the-edge-through-real-use-cases/\\nTitle: \\nContent: AWS Machine Learning Blog\\nDemystifying machine learning at the edge through real use cases\\nOctober 2023: Starting in April 26th, 2024, you can no longer access Amazon SageMaker Edge Manager. For more information about continuing to deploy your models to edge devices, see SageMaker Edge Manager end of life.\\nEdge is a term that refers to a location, far from the cloud or a big data center, where you have a computer device (edge device) capable of running (edge) applications. Edge computing is the act of running workloads on these edge devices. Machine learning at the edge (ML@Edge) is a concept that brings the capability of running ML models locally to edge devices. These ML models can then be invoked by the edge application. ML@Edge is important for many scenarios where raw data is collected from sources far from the cloud. These scenarios may also have specific requirements or restrictions:\\n\\nSource: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/demystifying-machine-learning-at-the-edge-through-real-use-cases/\\nTitle: \\nContent: If you already have an IoT application, you can add ML@Edge capabilities to make the product more efficient, as shown in the following figure. Keep in mind that ML@Edge doesn’t depend on IoT, but you can combine them to create a more powerful solution. When you do that, you improve the potential of your simple device to generate real-time insights for your business faster than just sending data to the cloud for later processing.\\nIf you’re creating a new edge solution from scratch with ML@Edge capabilities, it’s important to design a flexible architecture that supports both the application and ML model lifecycles. We provide some reference architectures for edge applications with ML@Edge later in this post. But first, let’s dive deeper into edge computing and learn how to choose the correct edge device for your solution, based on the restrictions of the environment.\\nEdge computing\\n\\nSource: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/demystifying-machine-learning-at-the-edge-through-real-use-cases/\\nTitle: \\nContent: The following are some of many use cases that can benefit from ML models running close to the equipment that generates the data used for the predictions:\\nAlthough ML@Edge can address many use cases, there are complex architectural challenges that need to be solved in order to have a secure, robust, and reliable design. In this post, you learn some details about ML@Edge, related topics, and how to use AWS services to overcome these challenges and implement a complete solution for your ML at the edge workload.\\nML@Edge overview\\nThere is a common confusion when it comes to ML@Edge and Internet of Things (IoT), therefore it’s important to clarify how ML@Edge is different from IoT and how they both could come together to provide a powerful solution in certain cases.\\n\\nSource: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/demystifying-machine-learning-at-the-edge-through-real-use-cases/\\nTitle: \\nContent: But how does IoT correlate to ML@Edge? IoT relates to physical objects embedded with technologies like sensors, processing ability, and software. These objects are connected to other devices and systems over the internet or other communication networks, in order to exchange data. The following figure illustrates this architecture. The concept was initially created when thinking of simple devices that just collect data from the edge, perform simple local processing, and send the result to a more powerful computing unity that runs analytics processes that help people and companies in their decision-making. The IoT solution is responsible for controlling the edge application lifecycle. For more information about IoT, refer to Internet of things.\\n\\nSource: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/demystifying-machine-learning-at-the-edge-through-real-use-cases/\\nTitle: \\nContent: Conclusion\\nIn this post, we discussed the different aspects of edge that you may choose to work with based on your use case. We also discussed some of the key concepts around ML@Edge and how decoupling the application lifecycle and the ML model lifecycle gives you the freedom to evolve them without any dependency on each other. We emphasized how choosing the right edge device for your workload and asking the right questions during the solution process can help you work backward and narrow down the right AWS services. We also presented different use cases along with reference architectures to inspire you to create your own solutions that will work for your workload.\\nAbout the Authors\\n\\nSource: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/demystifying-machine-learning-at-the-edge-through-real-use-cases/\\nTitle: \\nContent: Edge computing\\nDepending on how far the device is from the cloud or a big data center (base), three main characteristics of the edge devices need to be considered to maximize performance and longevity of the system: computing and storage capacity, connectivity, and power consumption. The following diagram shows three groups of edge devices that combine different specifications of these characteristics, depending on how far from they are from the base.\\nThe groups are as follows:\\nChallenges\\nIt’s common to have ML@Edge scenarios where you have hundreds or thousands (maybe even millions) of devices running the same models and edge applications. When you scale your system, it’s important to have a robust solution that can manage the number of devices that you need to support. This is a complex task and for these scenarios, you need to ask many questions:\\n\\nSource: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/demystifying-machine-learning-at-the-edge-through-real-use-cases/\\nTitle: \\nContent: The ML@Edge mechanism is not responsible for the application lifecycle. A different approach should be adopted for that purpose. Decoupling the ML model lifecycle and application lifecycle gives you the freedom and flexibility to keep evolving them at different paces. Imagine a mobile application that embeds an ML model as a resource like an image or XML file. In this case, each time you train a new model and want to deploy it to the mobile phones, you need to redeploy the whole application. This consumes time and money, and can introduce bugs to your application. By decoupling the ML model lifecycle, you publish the mobile app one time and deploy as many versions of the ML model as you need.\\n\', \'Source: https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/iot-and-future-edge-computing-europe\\nTitle: \\nContent: Several European initiatives demonstrate how responding to geopolitical challenges can be an opportunity to accelerate the green and digital transitions.
